<div class="about">
William Harrison has been interested in art since he was old enough to hold an object that was able to produce a mark on a surface. As a toddler, he was known to spend hours on end coloring entire pages of coloring books or paper a single color; green. As the years passed, his intrests evolved and he developed an appreciation for, and explored, Graphic Design, Graffiti, and Fine Art.

Overwhelmed with the seemingly endless possibilities of what is possible and can be considered art, he eventually narrowed his focus and set out to pursue the area of art that he found himself drawn to over and over again; Abstract Art. From hard edges, color blocks, soft gradients, he found his interest able to focus within this style.

As he continued to evolve as an artist, and with a narrowed focus, he beagn to explore the possibilities within this new found set of parameters and took to producing his own canvas stretchers and refining his methods and approach to producing artwork. His repitoire now includes a few processes that produce a randomized approach to generating concepts for artworks which allow him to tap people in his life to assist in the generation of his art. Furthermore, his interest in graphic art finds its way into his work, through illustrative style, hard edges, and geometric shapes.
